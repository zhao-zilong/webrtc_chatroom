# Unit test
- **SignalingServerTest.js**: this test is extended from your origin test, furthermore, I added the tests that a third user to connect other two. As I have rewritten the function onInit() and added a new function onLeave(), I tested also in this file.   
- **channelControlTest.js**:  for testing channelControl.js, I slightly modified original file to adapt unit test.
- **signalFactoryTest.js**: for testing signalingChannelFactory.js
- **signalingChannelFactory.js**,**channelControl.js**: modified javascript files to fit unit test
