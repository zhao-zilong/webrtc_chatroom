# Question 2

## What are the problems of this architecture?
When too much users connect, each user should maintain enormous peers, but if I don't want to broadcast my message, most of peers are not used. Meanwhile, without modifying the code, we can only create one group by one signaling server.
## Describe an architecture that could solve those problems.
In these circumstances, I will import a server for every chatroom. Each peer in the same room keeps a connection with his server, this server can provide a `nameservice`, this `nameservice` maps name of the peer to his address. And we create a connection only when a user demand.
- To show online users: a peer can demand server to get the online users list.
- To broadcast: a peer wants to broadcast some messages, it can just send a message to signalingServer with a tag ‘broadcast’, then this server can send to everyone in this room.
- To communicate between peers: when peer A wants to send a message to peer E, A will search the local connected peers, if E is not in this list, A will connect to signaling server and send a request to server, then server sends a message to E to force him connect to signaling server, then A and E can exchange configuration information through signaling server to create a p2p connection, then A and E will keep this connection and disconnect from signaling server, this architecture will reduce significantly the consumption of resource for signaling server and users.
